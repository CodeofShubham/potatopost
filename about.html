                <h2>Our Ridiculous Origin Story</h2>
                <p>It all started with a simple, yet profound, question in the mind of our founder, <strong>Komal Singh</strong>: "What is the most delightfully absurd thing one could possibly receive in the mail?"</p>
                <p>The answer arrived not in an epiphany, but in a bag of groceries: <span class="highlight-spud">The humble potato.</span></p>
                <p>In a world drowning in emails, notifications, and boring bills, Komal realized the potato held the key to true, tangible, and completely unexpected joy. It was the antithesis of predictable communication.</p>
                <p>Potato Post was born from the mission to champion the weird and the wonderful. We exist because sometimes, the only thing that can truly convey your feelings—be it a deep inside joke, a silly apology, or a declaration of mild affection—is a starchy, hand-written root vegetable delivered by the postal service.</p>

                <h2>Meet the Human Who Started It All</h2>
                <div class="founder-profile">
                    <h3>Komal Singh, Chief Executive Spud-Slinger</h3>
                    <p>Komal Singh is the visionary behind Potato Post. Like many great entrepreneurs, Komal’s journey didn't begin with a business plan, but with a Sharpie marker and a Russet.</p>
                    <ul class="clean-list">
                        <li><strong>The Philosophy:</strong> Komal believes that laughter is the best medicine, and potatoes are the best delivery system for that medicine.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Commitment:</strong> Komal personally ensures that every potato is high-quality, every message is legible (and sometimes slightly tilted for effect), and that your anonymity is protected at all costs.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> To make Potato Post the reason someone smiles awkwardly in front of their mailbox today.</li>
                    </ul>

                <ul class="clean-list">
                    <li><strong>100% Discretion:</strong> Your name is safe with us. Unless you specifically tell us to include it, the recipient will never know which starch-loving genius sent them a potato.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality Produce:</strong> We use premium, firm potatoes. They are canvases, not snacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hilarity Guaranteed:</strong> If your Potato Post doesn't elicit at least a chuckle, a head-scratch, or an immediate photo share, we haven't done our job.</li>
